# TextMeApp
This project app uses the Twilio API to allow users to send a text message to +14257287345, then have that text message edit the color of the pages background.

The app also uses Vue.js to display possible Css colors that users can use to update the page. 


On the front-end,
public/
  Index.html is the main html file
  client.js is the client side JavaScript file
  
Server.js is the serverside node express Javascript code

using Twilio to send and receive SMS > also adding the content of the SMS to the html

The app is at a solid 1.0 level right now. Going to add a few more things to make the app more interesting. The app also could use some styling things to make it look a bit more interesting too.
